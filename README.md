# Real-time Object Detection

This project is a real-time object detection application developed for Android using TensorFlow Lite. The app utilizes a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet v1** model to detect objects from the camera feed and display bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the device camera
- Draws bounding boxes around detected objects
- Displays object labels and confidence scores
- Lightweight and efficient model using TensorFlow Lite

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- An Android device or emulator with a camera
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin and Android development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
